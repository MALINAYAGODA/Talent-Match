## ⌛ Task
There are a lot of power lines in our country, which is why their maintenance takes a long time. For example, due to the lack of plate-type insulators, it leads to a voltage degradation. Therefore, Innopolis University decided to organize a hackathon to solve this problem: [Disc-type glass insulators absence detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/innopolis-high-voltage-challenge) 

💰 The first place prize was 350.000 rubles. Second and third got 250.000 and 100.000 rubles.


## 💾 Data
We were given several links to roboflow, thanks to which we marked up and collected a database of images in the size of > 1800 pieces. We also had 17 pictures for the test.

## Technologies 

We trained and tried several detection models, but YOLOv8m turned out to be the best. We also used SAHI technology👽 for inference.

🎯 The best scores **(~0.78 mAP50)** after the private session. As a result, after the performance, we took the 3rd place🥉;
